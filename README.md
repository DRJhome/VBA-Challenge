# Stock Analysis
* Creating a macro in VBA to analyize Stock Market data

## Ovierview of Project
 Use VBA to anaylize a two year stock market dataset. VBA code was written to daily volume and rate of return for for an entire calendar year. To increase the efficency of the VBA code we refactored the original VBA code. 

## Analysis
We worked with Steve to run analysis on some stocks that his parents were intersted in investing their money in. Steve was very happy with the results of the project. With the click of on button and entering the year he is interested in reviewing, all of the analysis is in front of him. I refactored the code to improve the speed of the VBA code while using less resources. 

The refractored code for 2017 ran in 0.078 seconds

## What are the advantages of refactoring code?
- Increases speed of program
- Makes the code easier to understand
- Helps find bugs
- Uses less memory and storage to process the same information

## What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?
- The developer must understand what the code is doing to improve it
- Refactoring code could produce bugs
- It could be risky in terms of time and money, to not make any improvements

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- The refactored VBA code increased in execution speed
- The code is working and refactoring could produce bugs
- The refactored code can save time, money, and reduce the memory and stoage use which would be very useful on larger projects.
